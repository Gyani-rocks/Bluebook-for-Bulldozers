# Bluebook-for-Bulldozers
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that uses structured data to build a regression model capable of predicting the price of a particular piece of heavy equipment (here bulldozers) based on its configurations.

The detailed dataset for working on the project can be found on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview
